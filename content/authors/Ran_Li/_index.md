## About Me

I'm a research assistant intern at the [Tsinghua University NLP Lab](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I have the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/), and work with a fantastic team of [Weize Chen](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=0CoGHtIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Ziming You](https://luffyzm3d2y.github.io/), [Yitong Guan](https://github.com/minleminzui), [Siyu yan](https://github.com/SGYSY), [Jiarui Yuan](https://github.com/1rubbishyuan). Prior to this, I received the bachelor degree in Computer Science & Mathematics in [Northern Arizona University](https://nau.edu/) in 2022. I am generally interested in natural language processing. Currently, I'm focusing on multi-agent systems and embodied agents.

**I'm actively seeking for PhD positions in 2025 fall**. If you are in search of a passionate researcher to join your team, please feel free to <a href="mailto:ran.li572482@gmail.com">contact me</a>. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to discuss potential research collaborations and opportunities.
