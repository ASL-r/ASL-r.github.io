#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm a research assistant intern at the [Tsinghua University NLP Lab](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I have the privilege of being advised by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/), and work with a fantastic team of [Weize Chen](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=0CoGHtIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Ziming You](https://luffyzm3d2y.github.io/), [Yitong Guan](https://github.com/minleminzui), [Siyu yan](https://github.com/SGYSY), [Jiarui Yuan](https://github.com/1rubbishyuan). Prior to this, I received the bachelor degree in Computer Science & Mathematics in [Northern Arizona University](https://nau.edu/) in 2022. I am generally interested in natural language processing. Currently, I'm focusing on multi-agent systems and embodied agents.

**I'm actively seeking for PhD positions in 2025 fall**. If you are in search of a passionate researcher to join your team, please feel free to <a href="mailto:ran.li572482@gmail.com">contact me</a>. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to discuss potential research collaborations and opportunities.
